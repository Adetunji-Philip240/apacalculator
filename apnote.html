            <span style="font-weight: bold">Arithmetic Progression (AP)</span>
            is a sequence of numbers in order, in which the difference between
            any two consecutive numbers is a constant value. It is also called
            Arithmetic Sequence. For example, the series of natural numbers: 1,
            2, 3, 4, 5, 6,… is an Arithmetic Progression, which has a common
            difference between two successive terms (say 1 and 2) equal to 1 (2
            -1). Even in the case of odd numbers and even numbers, we can see
            the common difference between two successive terms will be equal to
            2.
            <br />
            If we observe in our regular lives, we come across Arithmetic
            progression quite often. For example, Roll numbers of students in a
            class, days in a week or months in a year. This pattern of series
            and sequences has been generalized in Maths as progressions.

            What is a Arithmetic Progression?
          </h4>
          <p>
            In mathematics, there are three different types of progressions.
            They are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic Progression (AP)</li>
            <li>Geometric Progression (GP)</li>
            <li>Harmonic Progression (HP)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A progression is a special type of sequence for which it is possible
            to obtain a formula for the nth term. The Arithmetic Progression is
            the most commonly used sequence in maths with easy to understand
            formulas. <br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Definition 1:</span> A mathematical
            sequence in which the difference between two consecutive terms is
            always a constant and it is abbreviated as AP. <br />
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Definition 2:</span> An arithmetic
            sequence or progression is defined as a sequence of numbers in which
            for every pair of consecutive terms, the second number is obtained
            by adding a fixed number to the first one. <br />
            The fixed number that must be added to any term of an AP to get the
            next term is known as the common difference of the AP. Now, let us
            consider the sequence, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16,… It is considered as an
            arithmetic sequence (progression) with a common difference 3.

            Notation in Arithmetic Progression
          </h4>
          <p>
            In AP, we will come across some main terms, which are denoted as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>First term (a)</li>
            <li>Common difference (d)</li>
            <li>nth Term (an)</li>
            <li>Sum of the first n terms (Sn)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All three terms represent the property of Arithmetic Progression. We
            will learn more about these three properties in the next section.

            In this progression, for a given series, the terms used are the
            first term, the common difference and nth term. Suppose, a1, a2, a3,
            ……………., an is an AP, then; the common difference “ d ” can be
            obtained as;

            Find the nth term of AP: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…., an, if the number of terms

            n=15

            For an AP, the sum of the first n terms can be calculated if the
            first term, common difference and the total terms are known. The
            formula for the arithmetic progression sum is explained below:

          <p>
            Let us take the example of adding natural numbers up to 15 numbers.
            <br />
            AP = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

            Given, a = 1, d = 2-1 = 1 and an = 15
            <br />
            Now, by the formula we know;
            <br />
            Sn = n/2[2a + (n − 1) × d]
            <br />
            S<sub>15</sub> = 15/2[2.1+(15-1).1]
            <br />

            Solution: <br />
            Given, a = 10, d = 5, an = 95
            <br />
            From the formula of general term, we have:
            <br />
            a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n − 1) × d
            <br />
            95 = 10 + (n − 1) × 5
            <br />
            (n − 1) × 5 = 95 – 10 = 85
            <br />
            (n − 1) = 85/ 5

            Example 2: Find the 20th term for the given AP:3, 5, 7, 9, ……
            <br />
            Solution: <br />
            Given,
            <br />
            3, 5, 7, 9, ……
            <br />
            a = 3, d = 5 – 3 = 2, n = 20
            <br />
            an = a + (n − 1) × d
            <br />
            a<sub>20</sub> = 3 + (20 − 1) × 2 <br />a<sub>20</sub> = 3 + 38
            <br />
            ⇒a<sub>20</sub> = 41 <br />
            Example 3: Find the sum of the first 30 multiples of 4. <br />
            Solution: <br />
            The first 30 multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, ….., 120 <br />
            Here, a = 4, n = 30, d = 4 <br />
            We know, S<sub>30</sub> = n/2 [2a + (n − 1) × d] <br />
            S<sub>30</sub> = 30/2[2 (4) + (30 − 1) × 4] <br />
            S<sub>30</sub> = 15[8 + 116] <br />
            S<sub>30</sub> = 1860 <br />
            Example 4: Find a formula for the nth term of the AP 12, 5, -2...
            <br />
            Solution: <br />
            a = 12, d = 5 <br />
            Then <br />
            T<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d <br />
            T<sub>n</sub> = 12 + (n - 1)(-7) <br />
            T<sub>n</sub> = 12 -7n + 7 <br />
            T<sub>n</sub> = 19 - 7n <br />
            Example 5: The 6<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> of an AP are 0 and
            14 respectively. Find the first four terms of the AP <br />
            Solution: <br />
            T<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d <br />
            :. T<sub>6</sub> = a + 5d = 0 ....(i) <br />
            T<sub>13</sub> = a + 12d = 14 ....(ii) <br />
            Subtract (i) from (ii) <br />
            7d = 14 <br />
            Divide both sides by the coefficient of d (i.e 7) <br />
            :. d = 2 <br />
            Put d = 2 into (i), we have <br />
            a + 5(2) = 0 <br />
            a + 10 = 0 <br />
            Subtract 10 from both sides <br />
            a + 10 - 10 = 0 - 10 <br />
            a = - 10 <br />
            Therefore; <br />
            First term, a = -10 <br />
            Second term, T<sub>2</sub> = -10 + 2 = -8 <br />
            Third term, T<sub>3</sub> = -10 + 2(2) = -10 + 4 = -6 <br />
            Fouth term, T<sub>4</sub> = -10 + 3(2) = -10 + 6 = -4
