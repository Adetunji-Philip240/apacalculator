            Geometric Progression (GP)
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Maths,
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Geometric Progression (GP)</span> is
            a type of sequence where each succeeding term is produced by
            multiplying each preceding term by a fixed number, which is called a
            common ratio. This progression is also known as a geometric sequence
            of numbers that follow a pattern. The common ratio multiplied here
            to each term to get the next term is a non-zero number. An example
            of a Geometric sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, …, where the common
            ratio is 2.

            What is a Geometric Progression?
          </h4>
          <p>
            A <span style="font-weight: bold">geometric progression</span> is a
            special type of progression where the successive terms bear a
            constant ratio known as a common ratio. The next term of the
            sequence is produced when we multiply a constant (which is non-zero)
            to the preceding term. It is also commonly referred to as GP. The GP
            is generally represented in form a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup> .... where
            'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio of the
            progression. The common ratio can have both negative as well as
            positive values. To find the terms of a geometric series, we only
            need the first term and the constant ratio.

            Solved Examples of Geometric Progression
          </h4>
          <p style="font-weight: 500">
            Question 1: If the first term is 10 and the common ratio of a GP is
            3, then write the first five terms of GP. <br />
            Solution:
          </p>
          <p>
            Given, <br />

            First term, a = 10 <br />

            Common ratio, r = 3 <br />

            We know the general form of GP for first five terms is given by:
            <br />

            a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, ar<sup>4</sup> gotten from
            the formula: T<sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>(n - 1)</sup> <br />

            so; <br />

            T<sub>1</sub> = a = 10 <br />

            T<sub>2</sub> = ar = 10 × 3 = 30 <br />

            T<sub>3</sub> = ar<sup>2</sup> = 10 × 32 = 10 × 9 = 90 <br />

            T<sub>4</sub> = ar<sup>3</sup> = 10 × 33 = 270 <br />

            T<sub>5</sub> = ar<sup>4</sup> = 10 × 34 = 810 <br />

            Therefore, the first five terms of GP with 10 as the first term and
            3 as the common ratio are: 10, 30, 90, 270 and 810
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: 500">
            Question 2: Find the sum of GP: 10, 30, 90, 270 and 810, using
            formula. <br />
            Solution:
          </p>
          <p>
            Given GP is 10, 30, 90, 270 and 810 <br />

            First term, a = 10 <br />

            Common ratio, r = 30/10 = 3 > 1 <br />

            Number of terms, n = 5 <br />

            Sum of GP is given by; <br />

            S<sub>n</sub> = a[(r<sup>n</sup> – 1)/(r – 1)] <br />

            S<sub>5</sub> = 10[(3<sup>5</sup> – 1)/(3 – 1)] <br />

            = 10[(243 – 1)/2] <br />

            = 10[242/2] <br />

            = 10 × 121 <br />

            = 1210 <br />

            Check: 10 + 30 + 90 + 270 + 810 = 1210
